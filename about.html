                        My name is Donovan Jones-Myers, I'm 22 years old, and I grew in Minnesota. I'm both an engineer and artist going to Morhouse for a degree in applied physics and computer engineering. Generally, I like to spend my time reading, yo-yoing, watching various things, listening to music, and doing art such as drawing, photography, playing music, or digital art.
                        <br><br>
                        When it comes to my work, I like to explore different things. Whether it's though the subject, lighting, medium, time of day, angles, colors and so on, I try to find what speaks to me and pulls at my curiosity.
